TREs in the UK are internationally renowned for establishing the [Five Safes framework](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/secure-lab/what-is-the-five-safes-framework/), but they have some limitations for researchers. The manual application processes and disclosure checks make it challenging to keep up with today's scientific needs, like federated learning, analysis across sectors and research domains, and large-scale correlation studies.

TREvolution will address these challenges to evolve UK TRE capabilities across three themes:

-   **TRE reference architecture and implementations**: Standardising UK TRE architectures to enable seamless interoperability.
-   **AI and semi-automated output checking**: Enhancing research output review processes to ensure non-disclosure of personal information.
-   **Federated analysis**: Enabling secure analysis of datasets stored in multiple TREs located across the UK.

In addition to the the Universities of Nottingham, Dundee, Manchester, Swansea and West of England, the work will be delivered in collaboration with NHS Scotland, Lancashire Teaching Hospital, Durham University, Lancaster University, University College London, University of Queensland, University of Basel and University of Cape Town.

It builds on existing work done by the delivery partners, with experience across the themes, as well as the DARE UK (Phase 1) Driver Projects, which developed initial versions of some of the key components of TREvolution.

In the first collaboration, The University of Manchester established  [*Five Safes RO-Crate*](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/5s-crate): a mechanism of structurally documenting the evidence of computational processes, along with the chain of human reviews for legally accessing sensitive data. Five Safes [RO-Crate](/products/researchobject/) is based on open Web standards and wider community efforts and has been adopted by several research projects in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) including  [*EOSC-ENTRUST*](/projects/eosc-entrust/), and forms the basis for the common metadata standard of TREvolution.

TREvolution is the first of three initiatives under the [DARE UK (Phase 2) Transformational Programme](https://dareuk.org.uk/how-we-work/ongoing-activities/), advancing the further development and testing of core TRE components and capabilities developed in the first phase of the DARE UK programme.

Further funding will also be provided to support the early adoption of these capabilities by UK TREs and data services and to demonstrate their application through real-world research exemplars. The goal is to showcase the potential for a connected and efficient national network of secure data infrastructures.

The TREvolution team will work closely with the DARE UK Delivery Team and *early adopter* TREs, fostering stronger collaboration and synergy as these critical capabilities are integrated into the UK’s secure data research infrastructure ecosystem.

## Objectives

- **Objective 1**: Common standards for federation-ready, auto-assisted TREs: next generation of TREs to be underpinned by a common understanding and definition, and enhanced FAIR metadata, aligned with international initiatives
- **Objective 2**: Consistent real-time decision support for scaling trust: semi-automated, assistive process, where the risk of an analysis being disclosive is assessed in real time
- **Objective 3**: Standardising compute environments for scaling analytics: adoption of internationally accepted mechanisms to abstract the coding language from the computational environment
- **Objective 4**: Enabling a TRE network: collaboration of TREs that for a given project can form a transient inter-connected network
- **Objective 5**: Maintaining trust: build on DARE UK programme of public and stakeholder engagement where we have included their voices and inputs into our earlier projects

## eScience Lab involvement

The eScience Lab is leading the TREvolution approach to [FAIR](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and transparent analysis of sensitive data and use of [RO-Crate]().

The eScience Lab is expanding on its effort in the [federated analytics programme](https://federated-analytics.ac.uk/) in [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), building on two decades of experience providing computational analysis and data infrastructure to internationally support open research practices in life sciences and other disciplines.
