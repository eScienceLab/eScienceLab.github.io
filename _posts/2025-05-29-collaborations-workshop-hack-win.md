Michael Sparks recently attended [Collaborations Workshop 2025][CW25] (C25), [University of Stirling][UNISTIR], alongside a number of others from the [eScience Lab team][ESCIENCE] and Professor Caterina Doglioni from [University of Manchester][UNIMAN] [Physics & Astronomy][PHYSICS].

The [Collaborations Workshop][CW], is organised annually by the [Software Sustainability Institute][SSI]. It brings together researchers, software developers, data scientists, and academics. This explores and develops best practices in research software, fostering collaborative projects. This includes a hack day on the final day, with teams assembled on the day.

It was a pleasant surprise that [our hack on Green Metadata came first out of ten hacks from 10 teams][SSI_CW25_LI]. 

In that short time, we created initial versions of the following:

* A literature review summarising relevant sustainability standards
* An initial  green metadata schema definition (inspired by [CFF][CFF])
* A browser-based [Green Metadata metadata creation tool][GH_GM] (using [pyscript][TOOL_PYSCRIPT], [example][GM_YML])
* A [Django-based][TOOL_DJANGO] [platform][GH_MGD] designed for longer-term use and potential data correlation across projects

The full list of team members / affiliations:

* Professor Caterina Doglioni. ([University of Manchester][UNIMAN], [Physics][PHYSICS], [EVERSE][EVERSE])
* Michael Sparks ([University of Manchester][UNIMAN], [Physics][PHYSICS], [EVERSE][EVERSE], [eScience Lab][ESCIENCE])
* Lo√Øc Lannelongue ([University of Cambridge][UNICAM], [Green Algorithms][GREEN_ALGORITHMS])
* Christina Bremer ([University of Cambridge][UNICAM], [Green Algorithms][GREEN_ALGORITHMS])
* Will Haese-Hill ([University of Glasgow][UNIGLA])
* Jyoti Bhogal ([SSI Fellow][SSI_FELLOWS], [Research Software Alliance][RESA], [WEHI])
* Duncan Leggat ([UCL][UCL])
