The [Common Workflow Language](/projects/cwl/) (CWL) is a community-developed specification for interoperable scientific workflows, supported by multiple workflow engine vendors and open source projects. Started as a third-year project and further developed as part of the [BioExcel project](/projects/bioexcel/), the eScience Lab have developed the [CWL Viewer](https://view.commonwl.org/) to visualize these
workflows, show their annotations and composition. 

[CWL Viewer](https://view.commonwl.org/) has become the _de facto_ standard
web visualization tool for workflows within the larger CWL community - the list of 
[known workflows](https://view.commonwl.org/explore) shows more than 200 
individual contributions.
