The University of Manchester was awarded £10.3 million from
BBSRC/EPSRC to set up the Centre for Synthetic Biology of Fine and
Speciality Chemicals (SYNBIOCHEM), to develop new faster, more
predictable and reliable “greener” routes to fine and speciality
chemicals production.

The vision was to harness the power of Synthetic Biology (SynBio) to
propel chemicals and natural products production towards ’green’ and
sustainable manufacturing processes.

More broadly, the Centre would provide the general tools, technology
platforms and SynBio ‘know-how’ to drive academic discovery and
translate new knowledge and processes towards industrial exploitation,
through active collaborations with a large variety of industry
partners.

Within SynBioChem, the eScience Lab was supporting the DATA
sub-project, working to develop an integrated data and
metadata management platform for the centre based on [FAIRDOM-SEEK](/products/seek), openBIS,
LabArchives, and ICE.
