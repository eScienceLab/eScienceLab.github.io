The newly launched [Climate-Adapt4EOSC project](https://climate-adapt4eosc.eu/) joins the expanding European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) ecosystem, with a particular focus on climate change adaptation. Bringing together 18 partners from 9 countries, the initiative aims to advance open science and data-driven innovation to strengthen climate resilience and climate adaptation effots. 

Over the next four years, Climate-Adapt4EOSC will develop fully interoperable digital services, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data resources, and advanced analytical tools, equipping researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders with cutting-edge solutions for data retrieval, processing, and analysis to drive more effective climate adaptation efforts.


## Context

Adaptation to climate change has become a central focus for researchers across various fields, including climate science, environmental science, urban planning, information science and social science, to support policymakers in making informed decisions to build a climate-prepared and resilient society. The major challenges in achieving this goal are: 

1. Lack of seamless interaction between platforms, data spaces, and users  
2. Poor data interoperability as well as service interoperability  
3. Lack of infrastructural support for generating FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data  
4. Legal barriers hindering access to data

**Climate-Adapt4EOSC** aims to address these challenges by creating an **EOSC-centred collaborative research environment** that integrates existing EOSC data and services while expanding them with new capabilities. These enhancements include **interoperability, FAIRification, Open Data publication of research results, data adaptation, format compliance, mapping, and entity matching**, enabling seamless data interaction and the development of advanced services such as **Big Data analytics for climate risk assessments**.

A key innovation of the project is the development of a **climate change adaptation ontology** and an **EOSC Climate-Adapt Knowledge Graph**, designed to enhance **findability, accessibility, tracking, and life cycle management** of diverse research outputs, including **datasets, scientific publications, methodologies, code, software packages, and analytical tools**.

Additionally, Climate-Adapt4EOSC is introducing **three innovative services** that will support the **EU Mission on Climate Change Adaptation** and the **European Green Deal**. These services are designed to be **demonstrated across five EU countries**, ensuring practical implementation and impact in real-world climate adaptation efforts.
