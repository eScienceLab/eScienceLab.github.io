We are delighted to share the news that eScience Lab co-lead Stian Soiland-Reyes successfully defended [his PhD dissertation](https://www.uva.nl/en/content/events/2025/01/fair-research-objects-and-computational-workflows-a-linked-data-approach.html) 'FAIR Research Objects and Computational Workflows â€“ A Linked Data Approach' at the University of Amsterdam last week. 

His award comes after many years of publishing research at The University of Manchester, on reproducibility, provenance and metadata to improve FAIR sharing of open research data and computational workflows, within [ELIXIR Europe](/projects/elixir/), European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) projects including EOSC-Life and the workflow repository [WorkflowHub.eu](/products/workflowhub/), as well as building FAIR approaches for high-performance compute (HPC) environments and for federated analystics in Trusted Research Environments for health data.
