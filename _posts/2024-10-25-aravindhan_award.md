Aravindhan Rajasekar has been nominated and selected for inclusion in this year's UK Government Transformation 100, an award recognising individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the transformation of public services. Over 1400 nominations were made, so to be named in the Top 100 is a significant achievement. Government Transformation 100 Awards are held annually by Government Transformation Magazine, with the support of an Advisory Board of senior central and local UK government executives.

Aravindhan has held several posts in the civil service, including the Cabinet Office, and currently works in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Aravindhan has recently started a part-time PhD with Carole Goble and Stian Soiland-Reyes, looking at digital transformation in the UKâ€™s public health sector to enable federated analysis across multiple secure data environments in the NHS, clinics and research labs, and other public sector data custodians. This is funded as part of Health Data Research UK (HDR-UK Federated Analytics workstream). Manchester are partners and co-lead this programme.
