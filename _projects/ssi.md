**The Software Sustainability Institute was founded to support the UK’s research software community - a community that includes the majority of UK’s researchers**.

Its mission is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research ([better software, better research](http://softwaresaved.spreadshirt.co.uk/). Software is fundamental to research: [seven out of ten UK researchers report that their work would be impossible without it](http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers).

Organised around five teams ([community](http://www.software.ac.uk/community), [policy](http://www.software.ac.uk/policy), [software](http://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-group), [training](http://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-group), and [communications](http://www.software.ac.uk/what-do-we-do/training)) the Institute has built a large [network of Fellows](http://www.software.ac.uk/fellows) from across research disciplines; championed software and software career paths through House of Lords, BIS and RCUK reports; worked with [many projects to directly improve their codes](http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/case-studies), written an [extensive number of popular guides](http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything); and organised training events to [teach over 1,000 learners the basics of software engineering](http://www.software.ac.uk/software-carpentry) – thus helping thousands of people to build better research software.

The four institutions in the consortium – Edinburgh, Southampton, Manchester, Oxford – represent over 25 years of collaboration on software for research with unparalleled software engineering expertise.
