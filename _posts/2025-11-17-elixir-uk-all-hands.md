Last month, over 70 members and collaborators of the ELIXIR-UK, from 31 organisations met in Exeter for the annual All Hands meeting, a two-day event focused on connection, reflection and community building.

The meeting brought together researchers, data stewards and infrastructure leads from across the UK to share progress, exchange ideas and discuss priorities for the year ahead. Sessions covered topics ranging from national funding and sustainability to the practical use of AI in research.
