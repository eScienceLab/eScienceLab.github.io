[WorkflowHub](https://about.workflowhub.eu/) is a FAIR workflow registry sponsored by the European RI Cluster EOSC-Life, the European Research Infrastructure ELIXIR and multiple [EU-wide projects](https://about.workflowhub.eu/project/acknowledgements/#funding). It is workflow management system agnostic; workflows may remain in their native repositories in their native forms.

Join us on Fri Jun 30 2023 at 12:00:00 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time) for an exciting 2hr online event where you can ask any questions about WorkflowHub and workflows.

Other interested parties are also most welcome!
