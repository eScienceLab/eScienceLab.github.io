eScience Lab group co-lead Carole Goble sits on the steering committee of the [International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)](https://www.iscb.org/), and chairs the joint [ISMB/ECCB 2025 conference](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/home) this week, hosted at ACC Liverpool, UK.
The principal focus of this landmark annual event is the development and application of advanced computational methods to address biological problems. It brings together researchers from computer science, life sciences, mathematics, and related fields. Several tracks are running in parallel, including the [BOSC](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/bosc), [BOKR](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/bokr) and [Education](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/education) Communities of Special Interest, and [Bioinformatics in the UK](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/uk).
