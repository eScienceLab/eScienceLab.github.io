Registration is open for the 4th BioHackathon Germany, organised by de.NBI, for hands-on projects, networking, and innovation in bioinformatics. 
This year's event is hosted in the town of Walsrode, located between Hanover and Hamburg, and supports online/remote participation.  

There is a choice of eleven projects, including [10. On the path to machine-actionable training materials](https://www.denbi.de/de-nbi-events/1939-4th-biohackathon-germany-on-the-path-to-machine-actionable-training-materials), co-led by Nick Juty (University of Manchester eScience Lab / ELIXIR-UK) and Petra Steiner (University of Darmstadt). They are joined by Phil Reed (University of Manchester eScience Lab / ELIXIR-UK), Oliver Knodel and Martin Voigt (HZDR), as part of the [mTeSS-X project](https://esciencelab.org.uk/projects/mtess-x/). 

> In this project, we will work in parallel, interrelated streams:
> 
> - We will develop a strategy to identify similar or related training materials from distributed resources.
> - We will interlink related materials as Learning Paths where appropriate, and explore means to facilitate future automation.
> - We will improve the schemas.science profiles concerning ‘Course’ and ‘TrainingMaterial’ to propose how those could be updated to incorporate properties that facilitate exposure in Learning Paths.

To participate in this hackathon, please [register via the de.NBI website](https://www.denbi.de/de-nbi-events/1840-4th-biohackathon-germany). There is limited capacity for participation. Please be aware that you will have to cover your own expenses (travel, food, and so on).
