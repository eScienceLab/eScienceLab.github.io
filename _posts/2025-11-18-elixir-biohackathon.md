In November 2025, the eScience Lab returned to the annual [ELIXIR BioHackathon Europe](https://biohackathon-europe.org/) event, this time on the outskirts of Berlin, Germamy. Colleagues joined the over 300 participants from the life sciences research community to address crucial challenges in bioinformatics.

Three featured projects were supported by the eScience Lab:

- [New ELIXIR RIRs: Transparent and Automated Evaluation for a FAIRer Future](hhttps://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2025/blob/364145ab8d705846ef3c1d32ecdb091ea1153ec7/20.md) – led by Munazah Andrabi et al. Through an inclusive and transparent framework, Project 20 established automated validation checks and structured metadata, ensuring that ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resources (RIRs) can be easily discovered, assessed, and used by researchers and service providers.
- [Towards a Robust Validation Service for Data and Metadata in ARC RO-Crates](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2025/blob/364145ab8d705846ef3c1d32ecdb091ea1153ec7/28.md) – led by Eli Chadwick et al. The overall goal of Project 28 was to provide a powerful, holistic validation mechanism for ARC RO-Crates, enhancing their reliability, trustworthiness, and FAIRness.
- [Mining the potential of knowledge graphs for metadata on training](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2025/blob/364145ab8d705846ef3c1d32ecdb091ea1153ec7/18.md) – joined by Phil Reed and Finn Bacall.  In project 18, we created a queryable knowledge graph derived from training metadata in the Bioschemas format available from platforms including TeSS and glittr.org. 

This page will be updated as the project publish their [final reports on BioHackrXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/biohackrxiv/discover?search=biohackathon).
