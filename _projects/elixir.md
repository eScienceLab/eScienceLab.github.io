The goal of ELIXIR is to orchestrate the collection, quality control
and archiving of large amounts of biological data produced by life
science experiments. Some of these datasets are highly specialised and
would previously only have been available to researchers within the
country in which they were generated.

For the first time, ELIXIR is creating an infrastructure – a kind of
highway system – that integrates research data from all corners of
Europe and ensures a seamless service provision that is easily
accessible to all. In this way, open access to these rapidly expanding
and critical datasets will facilitate discoveries that benefit
humankind.

Science and technology change very quickly, and exploiting these
advances can be a challenge. ELIXIR partners are building an
intelligent, responsive and sustainable system that will deliver the
fruits of these advances to the scientists upon whom so many hopes are
pinned, and whose curiosity is the very cornerstone of progress.
