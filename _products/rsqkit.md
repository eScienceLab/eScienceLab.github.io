The framework for research software excellence incorporates aspects involving community curation, quality assessment, and best practices for research software. This collective knowledge is captured in the [Research Software Quality toolkit (RSQKit)](https://everse.software/RSQKit/), a knowledge base to gather and curate expertise that contributes to high-quality software and code across different disciplines.


## eScience Lab contributions

eScience Lab is heavily involved in [RSQKit design and development as part of EVERSE](https://everse.software/services/rsqkit/), by Aleksandra Nenadic, Michael Sparks and Shoaib Sufi.
