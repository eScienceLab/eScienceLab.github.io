The FAIR-IMPACT project will identify and design practical solutions, guidelines and frameworks to realise an EOSC of FAIR data and services. The project gathers 28 partners from 11 countries.

This project, funded by Horizon Europe call [HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-05](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-infra-2021-eosc-01-05) ([#101057344](https://doi.org/10.3030/101057344)), will support the implementation of FAIR-enabling practices, tools and services across scientific communities at a European, national, and institutional level.  The FAIR-IMPACT project will work to connect knowledge across scientific communities on **persistent identifiers**, **metadata and ontologies**, **metrics**, **certification** and **interoperability** aspects via a community-led approach.

### Target stakeholders

* (Meta)data services providers including Repository & PID Services (DSP)
* National Level Initiatives (NLI)
* Research Communities & Infrastructures (RI)
* Research Performing Organisations (RPO)
* Individuals in Science (IiS)
* Research Funding Organisations (RFO)
* Policymaking Organisations (PO)
* Publishers (PUB)
* Data Infrastructures beyond research (DI)
* EOSC Ecosystem (EE)
* FAIR Ecosystem (FE)
* Citizen Science Organisations (CSO)
* Scientific Societies & Academies (SS&A)

### Planned outputs

* A range of **governance, coordination and collaboration mechanisms** necessary for a functioning FAIR research ecosystem.
* **FAIR implementation action plans and workshops** to coordinate and support the adoption of FAIR-enabling components and mechanisms at multiple levels among a diverse group of stakeholders.
* A **persistent identifier support programme** and guidance for the provision of PID services in EOSC, including mechanisms and components to facilitate adoption and implementation of the EOSC PID Policy and alignment with PID practices.
* A **semantic framework** for the governance, creation, mapping, sharing, reuse, FAIRness assessment and interoperability of semantic artefacts for EOSC. This includes interoperable and harmonized semantic artefact catalogues, crosswalks and mappings to improve data findability and accessibility within and across disciplines. 
* **Guidelines and prototype(s)** which support both enabling FAIR and assessing the FAIRness and trustworthiness of different types of digital objects in multiple domains.
* Components and services for **increased legal, organizational, semantic and technical interoperability** in EOSC within and across disciplines.
* **FAIR implementation stories** providing evidence, guidance, exploitation paths and incentives for research communities and stakeholders.

## Coordination and Collaboration mechanisms

* Technical Bridging Team
* FAIR Implementation Team
* Synchronisation Force
* EOSC FAIR Champions
* National Roadshows

### eScienceLab involvement

The [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/) at the Department of Computer Science of The University of Manchester is participating in FAIR-IMPACT, contributing expertise on sharing [Research Objects](/products/researchobject/) using Linked Data with [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and [Bioschemas](/activities/bioschemas/).

UK partners in Horizon Europe projects are funded through [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) ([#10038992](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=10038992)) from the [UKRI Horizon Europe guarantee](https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/apply-for-horizon-europe-guarantee-funding/).

Use cases from [WorkflowHub](/products/workflowhub/) will contribute to FAIR-IMPACT work on persistent identifiers and metadata schema mappings.
