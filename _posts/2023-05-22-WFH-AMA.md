[WorkflowHub](https://about.workflowhub.eu/) is a FAIR workflow registry sponsored by the European RI Cluster EOSC-Life, the European Research Infrastructure ELIXIR and multiple [EU-wide projects](https://about.workflowhub.eu/project/acknowledgements/#funding). It is workflow management system agnostic; workflows may remain in their native repositories in their native forms.

Join us on Fri Jun 30 2023 at 12:00:00 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time) for an exciting 2hr online event where you can ask any questions about WorkflowHub and workflows.

Targeting particularly participants of [EuroScienceGateway](https://esciencelab.org.uk/projects/eurosciencegateway/), [Biodiversity Genomics Europe](https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/) and [BioDT](https://biodt.eu/) projects, we will provide guidance on how to use WorkflowHub to organise, share and publish their workflows. Other interested parties are also most welcome!

We will cover a varity of topics, including:

* How to best organise and maintain workflows on the Hub
* How to register workflows from your git repository
* How to access workflows from the Hub
* ..
