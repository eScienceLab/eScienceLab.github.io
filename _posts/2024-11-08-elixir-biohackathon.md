In November 2024, the eScience Lab returned to the annual [ELIXIR BioHackathon Europe](https://biohackathon-europe.org/) event, this time on the outskirts of Barcelona, Spain. Colleagues joined the over 300 participants from the life sciences research community to address crucial challenges in bioinformatics.

Two featured projects were co-led by the eScience Lab:

- [BioSchemas for mortals](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/10.md) – Nick Juty and Phil Reed, to simplify Bioschemas and increase accessibility for diverse user groups. They were joined by Munazah Andrabi and Finn Bacall.
- [Creating user benefit from ARC-ISA RO-Crate machine-actionability](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2024/blob/main/19.md) – Eli Chadwick developing tools for automated, machine-actionable data sharing.
