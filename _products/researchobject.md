_Research Object_ is an approach to the publication, and exchange of scholarly information on the Web.

Research Objects aim to improve reuse and reproducibility by:

* Supporting the publication of **more than just PDFs**, making **data**, **code**, and other resources **first class citizens of scholarship**
* Recognizing that there is often a need to publish collections of these resources together as one shareable, cite-able resource.
* **Enriching** these resources and collections with any and all additional information required to make research reusable, and reproducible!

## Research Object Crate (RO-Crate)

[RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate) is the recommended way to package and describe Research Objects. This is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. RO-Crate is based on [schema.org](https://schema.org/) annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments.

RO-Crate is used in several of our projects and products:

* [BioDT](/projects/biodt/) -- as a mechanism to publish [FAIR Computational Workflows](https://workflows.community/groups/fair/) as FAIR Digital Objects.
* [BioExcel](/projects/bioexcel/) -- As a way to capture Canonical Workflow Building Blocks <https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00135>
* [BY-COVID](/projects/by-covid/) -- As a way to package rich metadata and provenance together with the common provenance model <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5093125>
* [ELIXIR](/projects/elixir/) -- As part of GA4GH cloud activities
* [EOSC-Life](/projects/eosc-life/) -- as exchange unit with services like [LifeMonitor](https://lifemonitor.eu/) using the [Workflow Testing Crate](https://lifemonitor.eu/workflow_testing_ro_crate) profile <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4605654>
* [FAIR-IMPACT](/projects/fair-impact/) -- to help package semantic artefacts and their crosswalk mappings
* [SEEK](/products/seek/) -- being developed as an update to the previous Research Object Bundle export
* [Synthesys+](/projects/synthesys/) -- recording workflow outputs from Galaxy as a [Workflow Run Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/) profile and working with FAIR Digital Objects <https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00134>
* [Workflow Hub](/products/workflowhub) -- as storage format for workflows and their dependencies, using the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/)
