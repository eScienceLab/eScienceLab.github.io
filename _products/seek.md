The FAIRDOM-SEEK platform is a Web-based resource for sharing heterogeneous scientific research datasets, models or simulations, processes and research outcomes. It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved. FAIRDOM-SEEK is written in Ruby on Rails and Java.

Underpinning FAIRDOM-SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within FAIRDOM-SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.

FAIRDOM-SEEK incorporates semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.

FAIRDOM-SEEK is developed as part of the [EOSC-Life](/projects/eosclife/), [IBISBA](/projects/ibisba) and [FAIRDOM](/projects/fairdom/) projects 

As part of EOSC-Life and IBISBA, FAIRDOM-SEEK is being extended with support for Workflows and describing the results from analysis pipelines.
