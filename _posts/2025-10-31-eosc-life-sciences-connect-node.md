The ELIXIR Consortium, Euro-BioImaging, Instruct-ERIC and EMBL have joined forces to establish the EOSC Life Sciences Connect Node – a candidate European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) node dedicated to improving access to data, tools and workflows across the life sciences.

Following an open call in summer, the Life Science Connect Node was selected as part of the first wave of candidate EOSC nodes. The Node aims to strengthen open science capacity across domains by connecting resources, aligning standards, and supporting FAIR and ethically compliant data sharing.

A series of use cases will showcase the Node’s capabilities, from cross-domain image analysis to federated data storage in structural biology and multi-domain workflows through Galaxy. Together, these examples will highlight how the EOSC Federation can enhance research efficiency and interoperability across Europe.

UK partners involved in ELIXIR will contribute expertise, among others, in data stewardship, workflow interoperability and capacity building through their participation in the broader ELIXIR consortium.

> _“By working together, within the framework of EOSC, we can make an even greater collective contribution to open science”_, said Peter Maccallum, Coordinator of the EOSC Life Sciences Connect Node.
