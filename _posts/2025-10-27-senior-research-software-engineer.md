Join the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/) at the University of Manchester and help shape the future of climate data sharing and use in Europe! We're seeking a talented Senior Research Software Engineer to lead FAIR, ontology-driven approaches to climate data integration within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

You'll work at the cutting edge of reproducible research, semantic interoperability, and privacy-preserving data tracking—collaborating with climate scientists, technologists, and software engineers across Europe. From developing and contributing to knowledge graphs and FAIRification templates to driving open science practices and community consensus, this is a high-impact, team-driven role with global reach.

If you're passionate about improving how climate data is handled and shared and making research more open and interoperable, we’d love to hear from you.

## Climate-Adapt4EOSC

[ClimateAdapt4EOSC](/projects/climate-adapt), _Advancing climate adaptation through open science and data integration in the European Open
Science Cloud (EOSC)_, is a Horizon Europe funded project that specifically
empowers researchers across multiple disciplines to tackle climate change more effectively by
providing an advanced, EOSC-centred collaborative research environment. This environment
integrates existing EOSC data and services while introducing new datasets and innovative
features, such as FAIRification and Mapping and Entity Matching capabilities. 

The project will
create a climate change adaptation ontology and an EOSC Climate-Adapt Knowledge Graph,
enabling enhanced findability, accessibility, tracking, and life cycle management of diverse
research outputs. By fostering interoperability and innovation, the project will significantly
strengthen the capacity of European scientific communities to address climate change.

Manchester’s role leverages their expertise in reproducibility, interoperability, provenance and
their leadership in FAIR and reflects their involvement in various EOSC related projections and
initiatives (e.g. the EOSC Opportunity Areas) to aid integration into the broader EOSC ecosystem.

## About the role

The postholder will lead on strategy, research and development of FAIR, ontology driven
approaches to climate data and their adoption, evaluation and communication within and beyond
the boundaries of the project. This is a highly collaborative and consensus driven role and involves
working with research software engineers, climate experts and technology experts in the
Manchester team and partners across the project.

The postholder will be working closely with, and be line managed by the Manchester Principal
Investigator Dr Stian Soiland-Reyes and be part of the eScience Lab team based in the
Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester.

The role holder will
work with other research software engineers associated with the eScience Lab who have a climate
background, they will work with project partners and their use cases and collaborate alongside lab
experts and developers in FAIR and Research Objects. This co-working extends to colleagues at
partner sites and collaborators in the UK, Europe and worldwide.
