Funded by call [HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-06](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-infra-2021-eosc-01-06) 101058427, EOSC4Cancer will provide a federated infrastructure for the exploitation of cancer data for the [EU Cancer Mission](https://doi.org/10.2777/989951).

[EOSC4Cancer](https://eosc4cancer.eu/) brings together comprehensive **cancer centres**, **research infrastructures**, leading **research groups**, and major **computational infrastructure** across Europe to make the exploitation of the data possible.

EOSC4Cancer will prepare EOSC services for cancer research and enrich EOSC with data, tools and services from the cancer community.

## eScience Lab contributions

UK partners in Horizon Europe projects are funded through [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) from the [UKRI Horizon Europe guarantee](https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/apply-for-horizon-europe-guarantee-funding/).

In the EOSC4Cancer project the eScience Lab is involved in expanding the [RDMKit]() to make a _RDMkit4Cancer_, providing training support and use of [RO-Crate](/products/researchobject/) & [WorkflowHub](/products/workflowhub/):

* WP1 -- Federated data spaces to enable accessing, using, reusing and sharing cancer-related data
  - T1.4: Federated data flow and integration with cloud analysis platforms (lead: EMBL-EBI)
  - D1.1 Data resources map (lead: UMCG)
  - D1.2 Data access interoperability (lead: EMBL-EBI)
* WP3 -- Federated cancer data analysis through portals across Europe
   - T3.3: Virtual research environments  (lead: BSC-CNS)
   - D3.3 Virtual Research Environment interoperability (lead: BSC-CNS)
* WP5 -- Training and capacity building for key national and international stakeholders
	- T5.1: Identify and prioritize the existing gaps in training on the overarching project goal (lead: EATRIS)
	- T5.2: Implementation and delivery of training resources, relying, reusing and extending the existing resources, and aiming for the different audiences and domains evident in the consortium (lead??)
	- T5.3 Establishing a European training support network for cancer data research (lead: DTL)
    - D5.1 A guidance document for the EOSC4Cancer learning pathways (lead: CERTH)
	- D5.2 Courses portfolio, linked through the RDMkit Cancer View (lead: CNIO)
    - M5.2 - First content of the RDMkit Cancer View. - M20 (lead: UNIMAN)

We will also be helping [align EOSC4Cancer](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6771194) with the [FAIR-IMPACT](/projects/fair-impact/) project.
