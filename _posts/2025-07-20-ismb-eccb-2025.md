Professor Carole Goble, co-lead of eScience Lab, sits on the steering committee of the [International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)](https://www.iscb.org/), and is joint chair of the [ISMB/ECCB 2025 conference](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/home), hosted at ACC Liverpool, UK for the week of 20–24th July 2025. 

The principal focus of this annual event is the development and application of advanced computational methods to address biological problems. It brings together researchers from computer science, life sciences, mathematics, and related fields. Several tracks are running in parallel, including the Bioinformatics Open Science Conference ([BOSC](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/bosc)), special interest groups for Bio-Ontologies and Knowledge Representation ([BOKR](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/bokr)) and [Education](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/education), and [Bioinformatics in the UK](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/uk).
