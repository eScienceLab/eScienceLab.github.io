The life sciences are undergoing a transformation. Modern experimental
tools study the molecules, reactions, and organisation of life in
unprecedented detail. The precipitous drop in costs for
high-throughput biology has enabled European research laboratories to
produce an ever-increasing amount of data. Life scientists are rapidly
generating the most complex and heterogeneous datasets that science
can currently imagine, with unprecedented volumes of biological data
to manage.

Data will only generate long-term value if it is Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR). This requires a scalable
infrastructure that connects local, national and European efforts and
provides standards, tools and training for data stewardship.

Formally established as a legal entity in January 2014, ELIXIR - the
European life science Infrastructure for Biological Information - is a
distributed organisation comprising national bioinformatics research
infrastructures and the European Bioinformatics Institute
(EMBL-EBI). This coordinated infrastructure includes data standards,
exchange, interoperability, storage, security and training.

Recognising the importance of a data foundation for European life
sciences, the ESFRI and European Council named ELIXIR as one of
Europe’s priority Research Infrastructures. In response ELIXIR have
developed ELIXIR-EXCELERATE. The project will fast-track ELIXIR’s
early implementation phase by i) coordinate and enhance existing
resources into a world-leading data service for academia and industry,
ii) grow bioinformatics capacity and competence across Europe, and
iii) complete the management processes needed for a large distributed
infrastructure.

ELIXIR-EXCELERATE will deliver a step-change in the life sciences. It
will enable cost-effective and sustainable management and re-use of
data for millions of users across the globe and improve the
competitiveness of European life science industries through accessible
data and robust standards and tools.
