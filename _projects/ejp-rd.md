The European Joint Programme on RD (EJP RD) has two major objectives:

1. To improve the integration, the efficacy, the production and the social impact of research on RD through the development, demonstration and promotion of Europe/world-wide sharing of research and clinical data, materials, processes, knowledge and know-how;
2. To implement and further develop an efficient model of financial support for all types of research on RD (fundamental, clinical, epidemiological, social, economic, health service) coupled with accelerated exploitation of research results for benefit of patients.

To this end, the EJP RD actions are organized within four major Pillars assisted by the central coordination and transversal activities:

- **Pillar 1**: Funding of research;
- Pillar 2: Coordinated access to data and resources;
- Pillar 3: Capacity building;
- Pillar 4: Accelerated translation of research projects and improvement outcomes of clinical studies.
