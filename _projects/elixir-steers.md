[ELIXIR](http://elixir-europe.org/) unites Europe’s leading life science organisations in managing and safeguarding the increasing volume of data being
generated by publicly funded research. 
It coordinates, integrates and sustains bioinformatics resources across its [23 nodes](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes). 

ELIXIR enables users in academia and industry to access [services](https://elixir-europe.org/what-we-offer) (databases, software, training, standards, compute) provided through national Nodes. 
ELIXIR is the ESFRI Landmark for life science data and plays a unique role in the landscape, with millions of users globally, supporting the digital-needs of other ESFRIs and Horizon Europe research projects.

Increasingly, life-science data is held at national and institutional centres. Thus, large-scale data analytics requires that researchers can find and analyse data distributed across Europe. 

The purpose of **ELIXIR-STEERS** is to build capacity for large-scale, cross-border data analysis and for this capacity to be embedded across member states. 
ELIXIR-STEERS directly benefit Europe’s life scientists by allowing software and workflows to meet requirements of those using them in national centres. 
A ‘robust, reproducible and green’ approach to software and workflow provision will ensure that scientists have access to high quality, energy-efficient analysis tools. 

The project will also develop the crediting and recognition systems for software, supporting improvements to research assessment frameworks.
Further, ELIXIR-STEERS supports ELIXIR’s long-term operations by addressing the recommendations of the European Commission and ESFRI on the long-term sustainability of research infrastructures. 

It will strengthen the operational excellence of ELIXIR’s Nodes; support the training and development of professional and scientific staff in ELIXIR Nodes; expand the membership of ELIXIR to new countries, especially widening countries; enable international collaborations in particular with Latin America and Africa; and stimulate innovation and industry engagement.
Training-wise we will connect with our ELIXIR training portals [TeSS](products/tess/) and [RDMkit](/products/rdmkit/).

### eScienceLab involvement

eScience Lab will contribute work on credit and attribution for workflows in [WorkflowHub](/products/workflowhub), reuse of WorkflowHub workflows, [Workflow RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/), [FAIR Computational Workflows](https://workflows.community/groups/fair/) and [Bioschemas](/activities/bioschemas/).
