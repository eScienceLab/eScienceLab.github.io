The BeYond-COVID project ([BY-COVID](https://by-covid.org/)) aims to make COVID-19 data accessible to scientists in laboratories but also to anyone who can use it, such as medical staff in hospitals or government officials.

Pursuing to go beyond SARS-CoV-2 data, the project will serve as the groundwork to make data from other infectious diseases open and accessible to everyone.

The BY-COVID project strives to simplify data access and reuse through four key ‘pillars’:
 
1. **Mobilise data**: ensuring raw sequencing data from across the world can be easily submitted to core data hubs (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) (ENA), Federated [European Genome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/) (FEGA), [CESSDA social science archives](https://datacatalogue.cessda.eu/), and [BBMRI biobank directory](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/services/directory/)).
2. **Connect data**: build the technical capacity to allow linking of sequence data and metadata - expanding beyond scientific and medical data to broader metadata from for example public health and economics. Support integration to the [COVID-19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org). 
3. **Standardise data**: provide recommended data management protocols to encourage Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data standards and interoperability among resources. 
4. **Expose and analyse data**: support exposure and analysis of FAIR data on infectious diseases such as the regular VEO reports on mutations and variation in publicly shared SARS-CoV-2 data and the open [COVID-19 Galaxy analysis platform](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/)).  

BY-COVID is an exciting interdisciplinary project that unites life science, medical, policy, social science and public health experts from across Europe. Led by ELIXIR, the project has 53 partners from 20 European countries. The BY-COVID project will run for three years and is part of the European Commission’s [HERA Incubator](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/communication-hera-incubator-anticipating-threat-covid-19-variants_en.pdf) plan _Anticipating together the threat of COVID-19 variants_.

## eScience Lab involvement

Continuing work done with [ELIXIR](/projects/elixir/) and [EOSC-Life](/projects/eosclife/), eScience Lab is involved in BY-COVID to facilitate use of [RDMKit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), [WorkflowHub](/products/workflowhub/) and [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) for FAIR sharing of workflows, COVID-19 data and their citations.
